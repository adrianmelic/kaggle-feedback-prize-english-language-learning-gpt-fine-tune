It will be more about a better person, but that you're not even though you are going to do something you want to try something you will be something you are better because you dont do more. It will not be a bad or someone in life and is better because people that you can not be a good thing, they should be a good decision, so you want to do anything.\n","\n","First, people have you really want to see the same time. That is an example is the same thing in the life the world you are.\n","\n","Second, because you will be the most likely be a person who will make it, you like a person who is not be good because it is a good thing that you have to go to do and a person you will not be a good example of people who you are going to change your own decision you can see it for people, if you have to make someone who you are the same place.\n","\n","When you are you are not doing something that is going to be the same person to do anything, you are doing a person.\n","\n","In conclusion, some people like that, but some people are not only people's always doing something to say something you want to do something or you are not doing something.\n","\n","Second, people have to try something.\n","\n","In the best way you have to do it, you are trying to change in life.\n","\n","Lastly, the other people can be a bad thing about you. You will get it the best person you can not mean you have a good person. I think that you can do something beyond you will not matter what you want to do not have a good example of life, you do not try to do something.\n","\n","There are going to be something you can change yourself, because you like you are wrong. You can do it, you are always being someone is not to do nothing is because you want to do it.\n","\n","I believe that you have a better person and what you want. You can be always change your own. But you have to be yourself. you have to try something to do and you can do your own character traits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","Output 0\n","\n","generated: \n","oAssess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners.\n","This essay will be scored according to six analytic measures:\n","cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions.\n","\n","Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure.
